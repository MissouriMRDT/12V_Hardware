// schematic
connect 48V boost to VDD // chekced

U3 is not needed for logic  // checked

change anderson position // changed

section out LEDs // changed

power flag and led in vertical line // changed

12V_Log flag for LEDs // Changed	

group 48V // checked

anderson for 48V // changed

use both input pins for current sensor // changed

section  anderson connectors together with tiva headers // changed

Logic and act same layout // changed

keep schematic one direction and make it look pretty // changed

better flag names // Changed

oki off VDD for 3.3V // checked

GND for signal pins //checked

place pin names by the pin names //checked

change resistor values for LEDs // checked

// Layout
add curve to corner of edge cuts

change chokepoint of VDD 

no chkepoints to GND

via stitch the VDD plane

polygon plane top layer first than bottom layer

change thick traces to polygons and leds dont need thick traces

change GND traces and make traces more room

LEDs, fuses, and other components well labeled

silkscreen the pins net

change FET footprint // changed

remove 1K from FET // changed

change 100K to 10K on FET // chenged

move right side of board 50 mils and top board slightly up // changed

48V anderson horizontal not vertical // changed

// schematic 48V
add power driver to 48V boost // chenged

tiva line for 48V boost // changed
